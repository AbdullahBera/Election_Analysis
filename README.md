# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

In this analysis I am asked by Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee to audit the recent local congressional election. The election data is retrived from voters who cast their vote  through either mail-in ballot, punch cards or direct recording electronic machines. Using Python I am asked to compute: 

1. The total number of votes cast. 
2. The complete list of candidates who received votes and the total number of votes each candiate received. 
3. The percentage of votes each candidate received. 
4. The winner of the election according to popular vote. 

I extracted the data of the election results from the csv file located in Resources and I printed the results on a text file located in Analysis. Using for loops I made the code concise and ran it smoothly to extract all the information I was asked for. 

## Election Audit Results

1. The total number of votes cast in this election was **369,711**. I calculated the total number of votes by skipping the first row and then running a for loop through the rest of the rows. ![Total_votes](Resources/Total_votes.png)
